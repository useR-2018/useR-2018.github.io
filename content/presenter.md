Projectors in the rooms are 16:9, and have HDMI or VGA connections. You may need to have your own adapter if you want to use VGA with a Mac. Power will be available, but an Australian plug or converter is needed. It is a good idea to test out your slides during one of the breaks in the room that you will be speaking in. Rooms will have wifi, but don't expect extremely high bandwidth.

## Presentations

Presentations will be 20 minutes in length. Please include a couple of minutes for questions at the end. You should bring your own laptop to connect up with the screen, or your talk on a USB, to load it on someone else's laptop. There will be wifi, if you need to connect to the web.

## Lightning talks

Lightning talks will be 5 minutes in length. We will need to have these uploaded ahead of time, and run from one laptop. There will be some time at the end of the session for questions and answers.

## Posters

Posters will be electronic. You can connect using HDMI from your laptop - ideal if you want to demo things interactively - or on a USB. The size of the TVs are 47", which is quite large. There are a few 55" TVs, which you can request, if this is our preference. TVs will be on special stand with a ledge to hold the laptop, or information sheets to distribute.

Poster presenters will also have the option to do a **30 second** speed advertisement of there poster, after the first keynote. These will need to be uploaded ahead of time.
