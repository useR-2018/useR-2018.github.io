Are you curious about R? Do you want to brush up on your R skills before the conference kicks into full swing? Do you want to meet other newbies and mentors to build your R network?

R Ladies Australia, R Ladies New Zealand and R Ladies Remote are running a free tutorial "R Curious" led by Charles Gray, with the support of many R Ladies. It is aimed at newcomers to R, to get you up and running with key skills. 

You [need to sign up here](https://goo.gl/forms/k3FqgLd7RRnnaKT43) to attend. (You need to be registered for useR! 2018 to participate. Please use the same email address used when you registered.)

Following the tutorial there will also be a newbies lunch and R-Ladies gathering on Wednesday at lunch. Here you can meet other conference goers, and, if you like, to be paired up with a conference buddy and network with R-Ladies from all over the world!
