R Ladies Australia and New Zealand are offering a free tutorial "R Curious" led by Charles Gray, with the support of many R Ladies.  It is aimed at R newbies, who would like to brush up on their R skills and meet other newcomers and mentors, before the conference kicks into full swing.

You need to be registered for useR! 2018 to join, and you [need to sign up here](https://goo.gl/forms/k3FqgLd7RRnnaKT43) to attend.

Following the tutorial there will also be a newbies lunch, where you can meet other conference goers, and, if you like, to be paired up with a conference buddy.
