useR! 2018 will run Tuesday Jul 10 through Friday Jul 13, 2018. There will be [half-day tutorials Tuesday morning and afternoon, and Wednesday morning](https://user2018.r-project.org/tutorials/). Lunch, morning and afternoon teas are provided both days. The conference programme will begin after lunch on Wednesday, reception in the evening, and conference dinner Thursday evening. It will close late afternoon on Friday.

*Wednesday lunch time will feature a conference buddy matching session, for participants interested, and an R Ladies get together.*

		For over twenty years, R has been a programming language under development. In that time a collection of open source communities have sprung up around it. These communities have commonalities that are developing into a distinct programming subculture. The existence of a common subculture connecting these communities is important for two reasons: the power to create value and the potential to champion values.

    <td colspan="3">
			In the world of data visualisation much work has been put into defining a grammar for both static and interactive graphics. These efforts has often been coupled to the development of visualisation frameworks where the grammar has been reflected in the API design. Less attention has been devoted to a grammar of animation, and subsequently animation frameworks has often missed the breadth and composability that are the hallmark of grammar-driven visualisation frameworks. In this talk I will justify and present a grammar of animation and position it in relation to graphics and interactivity grammar, thus creating a clear division of responsibility between the three domains. I will present an R implementation of the grammar of animation which builds on top of the ggplot2 framework and made available as the gganimate package, Using examples with gganimate I'll show how the proposed grammar can be used to break down, and reason about, animated data visualisation, and how the grammar succinctly can describe very diverse animation operations.

		I will discuss two recent analyses, one from psycholinguistics and the other from fisheries, that show the versatility of R to tackle the wide range of  challenges facing the statistician/modeller adventurer.  I will conclude with a more generic discussion of the status and role of data in our contemporary  analytical disciplines and offer an alternative perspective from the current orthodoxy.

The intentional ambiguity of the R language, inherited from the S language, is one of its defining features. Is it an interactive system for data analysis or is it a sophisticated programming language for software developers? The ability of R to cater to users who do not see themselves as programmers, but then allow them to slide gradually into programming, is an enduring quality of the language and is what has allowed it to gain significance over time. As the R community has grown in size and diversity, R’s ability to match the needs of the community has similarly grown. However, this growth has raised interesting questions about R’s value proposition today and how new users to R should be introduced to the system. I will discuss some lessons learned from my experience teaching R to new users and from observing the evolution of the language over the past 20 years.

	Traditionally, R has been viewed as a language for data science and statistics. In the social sciences it has been extremely popular with researchers at the more quantitative end of the spectrum - but uptake has been less widespread outside of the more statistically inclined. I don't think the R language needs to be limited in this way. Since 2011 I've been teaching introductory research methods classes for undergraduates using R, running programming classes for R with postgraduate students, doing my own data analysis with R, implementing cognitive models with R and occasionally even running behavioural experiments in R. In this talk I reflect on some of these experiences - the good, the bad and the ugly - and discuss prospects and challenges for wider adoption R as a tool within the psychological sciences.

    <td colspan="3">
		"Code smell" is an evocative term for that vague feeling of unease we get when reading certain bits of code. It's not necessarily wrong, but neither is it obviously correct. We may be reluctant to work on such code, because past experience suggests it's going to be fiddly and bug-prone. In contrast, there's another type of code that just feels good to read and work on. What's the difference? If we can be more precise about code smells and feels, we can be intentional about writing code that is easier and more pleasant to work on. I've been fortunate to spend the last couple years embedded in a group of developers working on the tidyverse and r-lib packages. Based on this experience, I'll talk about specific code smells and deodorizing strategies for R.
