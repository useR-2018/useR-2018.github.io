		For over twenty years, R has been a programming language under development. In that time a collection of open source communities have sprung up around it. These communities have commonalities that are developing into a distinct programming subculture. The existence of a common subculture connecting these communities is important for two reasons: the power to create value and the potential to champion values.

		I will discuss two recent analyses, one from psycholinguistics and the other from fisheries, that show the versatility of R to tackle the wide range of  challenges facing the statistician/modeller adventurer.  I will conclude with a more generic discussion of the status and role of data in our contemporary  analytical disciplines and offer an alternative perspective from the current orthodoxy.

		"Code smell" is an evocative term for that vague feeling of unease we get when reading certain bits of code. It's not necessarily wrong, but neither is it obviously correct. We may be reluctant to work on such code, because past experience suggests it's going to be fiddly and bug-prone. In contrast, there's another type of code that just feels good to read and work on. What's the difference? If we can be more precise about code smells and feels, we can be intentional about writing code that is easier and more pleasant to work on. I've been fortunate to spend the last couple years embedded in a group of developers working on the tidyverse and r-lib packages. Based on this experience, I'll talk about specific code smells and deodorizing strategies for R.
