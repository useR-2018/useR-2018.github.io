## What to do when you arrive at the conference:

- We want everyone to have a good conference experience, and you have all signed off on the Code of Conduct, that we will be operating under. It is on the web site if you want to  refresh your memory. If you want to report a violation, you can talk with one of the organisers wearing a royal blue t-shirt, or call the contact number.
- Conference helpers sporting orange buffs will be roaming around. Talk to any of them to get help.

## Conference programme:

- The website https://user2018.r-project.org has the latest schedule.
- Please check this, especially if you are a presenter. If you see any problems please let us know - it is still possible to make some small changes. The details for presenters are posted on the web site.
- The conference is being recorded and will be posted on youtube after the event. If you are presenting, AND DO NOT WANT TO BE RECORDED YOU NEED TO EMAIL US.
- There is also a mobile app that has the program and details about the convention centre.  Instructions for installing are these:

     1. Download the “BCEC Live” App from the Google Play Store or the Apple App Store
     2. When opening for the first time, make sure to allow notifications
     3. Inside the App select “Your Event App”
     4. Select “Type Code”
     5. Use the access code “useR2018”
     6. Have a look around!

- The procedure for tutorials is that if you have registered for a time session and it is indicated on your name badge, you simply turn up to the tutorial of your choice. You will need to show your badge at the door. Be sure to check the details on the web, for what to install ahead of time. You may have received these in email but its good to check the web too.
- Wed morning there is a free introductory R tutorial, RCurious. You are welcome to join this  if you are new to R. Following the tutorial there will also be a newbies lunch and R-Ladies gathering on Wednesday at lunch. Here you can meet other conference goers, and, if you like, to be paired up with a conference buddy and network with R-Ladies from all over the world! It  will likely be in the room P11.
-  If there is sufficient interest, we plan to have an opportunity for an employers/employees  meetup during one of the tea breaks. If you are an employer with potential job openings who would like to be connected with people looking for positions, please email buseco-user2018@monash.edu as soon as possible, expressing your interest in being included.
- Some sponsor representatives will be roaming around with interests in talking with participants. These are the two that I am aware of at the moment:
   
    - Stephen Jones, Springer’s Commissioning Editor for Statistics in Australia and New Zealand,  will be attending the Conference on Wednesday 11 and Thursday 12 July. Springer has an   excellent reputation for quality as the largest publisher of research books in the world, and is always looking for new, high-quality research to add to their strong statistics list.  If you already have a specific book idea you’d like to discuss in detail, or if you’d like to pick  up this conversation in general, please drop by the Springer booth. Alternatively, you can  contact Stephen at stephen.jones@springer.com
    - Chester Ismay, DataCamp's representative, is interested in talking with people interested in   building an online course offering.
   
## Social programme:

- The opening reception is Wednesday from 5:30 in the foyer of the auditorium. This is free to  all.
- Wednesday evening, there is a big event, not associated with the conference, called State of   Origin. This is a rugby match pitting players from NSW against Queensland. Its a huge event and a good place to experience 'local culture'.
- Thursday evening is the conference dinner, a ticket event. Tickets will on sale until
- Tuesday July 3rd, when we need to give final numbers to caterers. There are approximately 40 tickets still available.

## Social media:

   The twitter handle for the conference is @useR2018_conf and hashtag #useR2018. Its also good to     add the #rstats. There will be StickerMule coupon prizes for active tweeters.
